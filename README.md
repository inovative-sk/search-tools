Do you know what people search for on your website, actually? WordPress core doesnâ€™t store any statistical data, but the Search Tools plugin shows detailed insights about the history of searched terms. The Insights is a great analytics tool which tells you what users really look for. No personal data is saved.

Free version of the plugin extends the default search engine. It allows searching in post types, taxonomies, authors and meta data. The results are ordered by relevance not post date. All these parts of the WordPress are not included in the basic search. You can customize the settings by yourself to fit your needs.
