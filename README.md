## Search Analytics

Do you know what people search for on your website, actually? WordPress core doesnâ€™t store any statistical data, but the Search Tools plugin shows detailed insights about the history of searched terms. The Insights is a great analytics tool which tells you what users really look for. No personal data is saved.

## Highlight Search Term

The search term is highlighted in the search results WordPress page. Eye catching CSS animation enhances user experience and visual mark speeds up finding relevant post. The highlight MUST BE ENABLED first! Furthermore, highlight can be enabled/disabled and settings are fully customizable. Both background and text colours can be set in the plugin options page.

## Extend the Search

Free version of the plugin extends the default search engine. It allows searching in post types, taxonomies, authors and meta data. The results are ordered by relevance not post date. All these parts of the WordPress are not included in the basic search. You can customize the settings by yourself to fit your needs.

## Disable Search

The plugin prevents WordPress from allowing and handling any search requests from the front-end of the site. If search is not used on the website, it is useful to disable it completely. The seach form is hidden, if called with a standard `get_search_form()` function, the search requests redirect to a 404 error page. The setting is customizable.
